# Smart Home Simulation
**Authors**: [Artem Aivazian](@aivazart), [Illia Zozuliak](@zozulil)
## Description
Create an application for virtual simulation of a smart home, where we simulate the operation of the household, use individual home devices and evaluate the use, consumption, leisure and working time of individual persons.

## Design patterns
- **Composite** <br/>
Is needed to build complex events.
- **Observer** <br/>
Maintain notification logic between sensors and devices. 
- **Builder** <br/>
Is needed to build house.
- **State** <br/>
Is needed to switch states of devices.
- **Command** <br/>
Is needed for creating enents.
- **Factory method** <br/>
Is used to create simulations.


## Config
All configuraion data are located in Simulation classes.
